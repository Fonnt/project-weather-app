# Weather App
This weeks project was to build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

We worked together at first and then in branches and learned how to do that. We also used public API that we fetched and filterd the information through JSON. We worked with date() and how to convert the respons to display the correct time. We had problem with adding a zero to the left of the timestamp, when we were using getHours and getMinutes(). For this we created a function with an if statement. At first we also hade some trouble understanding the filter function, but when we understood it we could use it to loop through the response and get the information we wanted. 

If we had more time we would have implemented a list of more citys or a searchbar for any city. We would added also a geolocator for getting weather based on that.
